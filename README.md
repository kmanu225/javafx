# JavaFX Framework

JavaFX is a framework for creating desktop applications in Java. It provides a rich set of UI controls, easy integration with CSS, and support for FXML to separate UI design from application logic.

## Key Concepts

- **Stage**: The main window of the application.
- **Scene**: The content within a stage. A stage can switch between different scenes to represent different views.
- **FXML**: An XML-based language used to define the UI structure.
